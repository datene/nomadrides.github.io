    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to try out a completely different concept, the Startup House.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As remote worker, I'm used to go on working sessions alone or with maximum 1-2 other workers.
But I got the opportunity to attend a Startup House and live with 15 startuppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whats-a-startup-house"&gt;What's a Startup House?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Startup House is a big flat or house shared with startupers where everyone is working and living there. We call it co-living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the idea is to join a house with our own startup project and use this exceptional environment to be focused on our project, push a ton of features and launch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Coworking table" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/coworking-table-bab557dd.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="budapest-the-experiment"&gt;Budapest, the experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December, I landed in Budapest for a first try of a house full of entrepreneurs.
This was a 1 month &lt;a href="http://startuphousebudapest.com/"&gt;ephemeral project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house, in a few numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;200 m2&lt;/strong&gt; with 4 bedrooms &amp;amp; 1 living room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 nationalities&lt;/strong&gt; coming from UK, The Netherlands, France, Turkey, Belgium, Croatia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5+ different skills&lt;/strong&gt; from web developer to Turkish jewellery manufacturer including CTO, marketing consultant, coaches, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Startup House Budapest" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/startup-house-budapest-961ad4b9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-great-journey"&gt;A great journey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, working and living in the flat, we had many more activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talks&lt;/strong&gt; organized by and for each other&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; coming from local startups such as &lt;a href="http://edmdesigner.com/"&gt;EDMdesigner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/"&gt;Ustream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gym &amp;amp; therms&lt;/strong&gt; sessions (a lot!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coworking spaces&lt;/strong&gt; visits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Budapest&lt;/strong&gt;, its history, districts and night life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, we also hang out a lot!
For more details about Budapest, have a look at my &lt;a href="/blog/2016-02-17-budapest.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="LOffice Café" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/loffice-cafe-0d909d8c.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="LOffice Coworking" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/loffice-coworking-ff27f007.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="paris-the-long-term-house"&gt;Paris, the long-term house&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment in Budapest was a massive success. We met up amazing people, had some hardcore startup work and talks. In a word we had such a great experience that organizers decided to launch a new Startup House. This new one would be a long-term house in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I crashed in this new house for a few days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some facts again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;both &lt;strong&gt;coliving&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coworking&lt;/strong&gt; house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100 m2&lt;/strong&gt; with 3 bedrooms &amp;amp; 1 living room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5+ different skills&lt;/strong&gt; with brand founder, graphist, developer, bootcamp student, business intelligence consultant, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;weekly events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is totally different. It looks more like a room sharing apartment than a startup retreat apartment but still for startupers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Living room" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/living-room-41090a5d.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Coworking area" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/coworking-area-fd65e103.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="will-i-join-a-startup-house-for-a-living"&gt;Will I join a startup house for a living?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to spend all our time in the same place. Spending 24 hours a day in the same house, all together, I don't think it's sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of living in a startup house and meeting people there but working from somewhere else and also meeting people from other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-new-family"&gt;A new family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can say is that I joined a new family, the Startup House family. And this one is becoming bigger every day.
I'm really happy to have been part of the first edition and can't wait to visit the next ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a delight to have 5+ startup house roommates per city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Brunch" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-04-10-startup-house/brunch-b9b78d42.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the &lt;a href="http://thecoalition.io/"&gt;Startup House Coalition&lt;/a&gt; project. They're currently launching more cities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey there. If you've never been to Budapest, I hardly recommend you to visit this city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is the longest remote working session I've done so far. I've been there for 2 weeks and here is my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="startup-house-budapest"&gt;Startup House Budapest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always used to go on working session either alone or with a bunch of other remote workers. This time, I joined a project called &lt;a href="http://startuphousebudapest.com/"&gt;Startup House Budapest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Startup House Budapest" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/startup-house-5d90d785.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll talk more about this project in a future post. So concretely, I was sharing a huge flat with 15 people. What an experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="weeks"&gt;2 weeks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're in a city for just a couple of days, you have to make a schedule in order to optimize the time you're there. But within 2 weeks, you really have time to discover a city and to really live like a local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, compared to my other trips, this time, I think I put less pressure on me and just lived by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="working"&gt;Working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="from-the-startup-house"&gt;From the startup house&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to work from the house. I took time to work on &lt;a href="http://gemsavvy.tips/"&gt;side projects&lt;/a&gt; and to coach 3 alumni from &lt;a href="http://lewagon.com/"&gt;Le Wagon&lt;/a&gt; that were also in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Working at the Startup House Budapest" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/startup-house-budapest-cfed935f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a cool experience but I thought that it was sad to don't meet any local entrepreneur. So we decided to get out of the house!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="coworking-spaces"&gt;Coworking spaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some of the folks from the house, we visited 2 coworking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Rohit welcomed us at &lt;a href="http://thehub.hu/"&gt;thehub.hu&lt;/a&gt;. This is a coworking space with both fixed desks and hotdesks plus everything you may need to work: tea, coffee, wifi, great chairs, …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Working from thehub.hu" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/the-hub-coworking-978e5480.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Christmas tree at thehub.hu" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/the-hub-christmas-tree-57eca986.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we visited &lt;a href="http://loffice.hu/"&gt;LOffice&lt;/a&gt; which is located in the same street as thehub.hu. This is a beautiful coworking space with a café / bistro on the rooftop of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="LOffice coworking space" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/loffice-coworking-45f6ec04.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Working at LOffice" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/working-at-loffice-3bf18748.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 spaces have a calm atmosphere: perfect to be productive. If you have to choose between the 2 of them, thehub.hu might be more for tech people and the second one more for designers. But I recommend you to try both of them and make your own judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bistro on the rooftop of LOffice" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/loffice-bistro-0197fa93.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visiting"&gt;Visiting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, within 2 weeks I had time to visit the city. I recommend you the &lt;a href="http://www.triptobudapest.hu/"&gt;Free Walking Tour&lt;/a&gt;. They propose a classic tour of the city, a tour of the Jewish quarter and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="food-specialties"&gt;Food specialties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be interested to try the local food. They have a lot of specialties: goulash, sausage sandwich, langos, …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hungarian Bratwurst" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/bratwurst-b251a3ed.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Langos" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/langos-1bf8a56f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, test the restaurants dedicated to workers. They're cheap (~ 3€ per dish) and propose traditional Hungarian cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Goulash" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/goulash-341e92b3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cheap dishes in cafeterias" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/budapest-cafeteria-cheap-dishes-8669fc93.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hungarians use a lot of paprika in their dishes. Their coffee is also pretty famous. Both of them are heritage from Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, if you like wine, you'll be happy to hear that Hungarian wine is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="therms"&gt;Therms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is the thing you should try in Budapest. The city has a lot of therms. Within 2 weeks, I tried 3 of them: &lt;a href="http://www.szechenyibath.hu/"&gt;Széchenyi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gellertbath.hu/"&gt;Gellért&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.rudasfurdo.hu/"&gt;Rudas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them have therm baths, swimming pools, sauna, hammam and external therm bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Széchenyi is one of the oldest and biggest therms of Budapest. Its 2 big external therm baths are really impressive. Have a look at it at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Széchenyi external baths" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/szechenyi-therm-3ea93669.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 other baths are on Pest side. Gellért is really huge with its external swimming pool, bath and sauna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite one was Rudas. The only Turkish therm in Budapest. Within the same room, there is a big therm bath and 4 smaller ones with different temperatures that go from 20 to 42 degrees. Bonus point for the view of Pest from the bath on the rooftop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jewish-quarter-and-ruin-bars"&gt;Jewish quarter and ruin bars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Quarter is the place to be at night. You'll find everything you want in Kazinczy street, from really good restaurants to excellent ruin bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Special duck dish at Kazimir" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/kazimir-duck-specialty-46f8c1a1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Salmon dish at Kazimir" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/kazimir-salmon-dish-7b692a3b.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially recommend you &lt;a href="http://bistro.kazimir.hu/en/"&gt;Kazimir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kolevesvendeglo.hu/en/"&gt;Köleves Vendéglö&lt;/a&gt; restaurants. For the ruins bars, you should try &lt;a href="http://www.szimpla.hu/en/"&gt;Szimpla&lt;/a&gt; - the oldest one, Ellátó kert and Extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Extra ruin bar" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/extra-ruin-bar-7d9cedc9.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Extra kert" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-02-17-budapest/extra-kert-5ede2a4a.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you joining me either in Amsterdam or in Lille? Let's meet!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The summer was here yet the clouds decided to stay in Lille, so it was
time to take off to… Portugal!!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was born in Peniche and as a lover of everything that
can glide (please…), with surf coming in my top-3 list, I was getting
an opportunity to meet the tide of this famous area, in incredible
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="peniche"&gt;Peniche&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little background, Peniche is located in the south of Portugal and is
known for its famous spots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baleal that used to be a very small island is now crowded with
surfers and surf schools and is no longer an island. They connected
it to the lands with sand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supertubos where an international surf competition takes place every
year and where the most famous international surfers meet to defy one
of the biggest wave in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you can guess, it was easy to trade my longboard for a surf!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cécile, Hervé, Tiphaine and Greg from &lt;a href="http://lacoroutine.org/"&gt;La Coroutine&lt;/a&gt; joined the adventure.
After a long journey by car, plane, metro, bus and taxi… we finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Baleal surf spot in Portugal" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/baleal-surfspot-02f6d4a5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="working--surfing"&gt;Working &amp;amp; Surfing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a big picture, our days where very tiring. Yeah, so hard such as enjoying a
cocktail behind a veranda, facing the sea while working on the
computer. I found watching the kites very relaxing while searching for
inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Working from bars" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/working-from-bars-5f44910f.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Chill from bars" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/chill-from-bar-5a166864.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beach and surf sessions eventually happened as soon as we
could, of course. I discovered marine longboarding also ‒ a very long
board that let you ride for a long time espescially when the tide is
low. You can walk on it, jump, even make figures if you're feeling
lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Surf Profesionals" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/surfing-pros-4c01024b.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also rented bikes, longboarded from Baleal to Peniche, enjoyed a few
BBQs, played Mölkky, discovered the famous portuguese chocolate
saucisson and tasted awesome shrimps cooked with a whisky sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Playing Mölkky" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/playing-molkky-7b7858ad.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Bike Ridding" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/riding-bikes-89a35d69.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Longboarding" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/longboarding-6277e234.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Whisky sauce Gambas" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/whisky-gambas-e5173d04.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visiting-lisbon"&gt;Visiting Lisbon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days, we moved to Lisbon. We discovered this city and its
typical areas. It's really beautiful, mixing old and new styles of
different centuries. There are a zillion of small restaurants, cafes and
bars where you can hang and just enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisbon, Portugal" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/lisbon-645c664f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fun-facts--hints"&gt;Fun facts &amp;amp; Hints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-castle-area"&gt;The Castle Area&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, nevertheless, managed to hurt myself. I was so enjoying a
lonnnng wave that I forgot to jump before reaching the reef. In a
fraction of time, I looked at the sea, noticed a deep dark colour
underneath and shouted VERY strongly in my head a very simple word:
"FUCK". I had to choose between jumping on the rocks and hurting my feet
or breaking the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems like my brain decided my feet
where cheaper than a surfboard and so decided to jump. If that matters,
it wasn't rocks. Well, to be fair: not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; rocks. They were
urchins. Motherfucking urchins. Now my feet were ruined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day later, we decided to rent Stand Up Paddles (SUP). The guy told
us "if you don't want to ruin your holidays, just avoid going after the
surf castle area". Well, that was exactly where I was the day
before… funny, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Surfing Master" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/surfing-master-5e5c1ce7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="you-can-bring-amazing-stuff-in-a-plane"&gt;You can bring amazing stuff in a plane&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! You can bring your own scanner in a plane. While it makes funny
faces during checks at the airport, it's fine. Greg had to take it because
he was finishing a comic book and had to scan and ink everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the fun of it, he decided to forget to bring the USB cable. Ahah, first mission then
was to find a new USB cable in a spot where you have more surfboards than
computers. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="doing-sport-while-remote-working"&gt;Doing sport while remote working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and I forget to mention that in fact… I've never been so productive
by practicing sport during the half of each day. Give it a try, you may
be surprised!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Peniche, Portugal" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-09-01-portugal/portugal-peniche-e70b1fc9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey there, this is Claire! I'm a &lt;a href="http://www.lesfilmsdesdeuxmains.com/"&gt;short-documentary film maker&lt;/a&gt; working from &lt;a href="http://lacoroutine.org/"&gt;La Coroutine&lt;/a&gt; coworking space (Lille, France).
Few months ago Cecile proposed me a remote working session.

Whassat?! A what?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="remote-working"&gt;Remote working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me (re-)introduce you the concept: as a freelancer, you go to work in another country or city than your usual working place.
I immediately loved the idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why"&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I like to wander around and meet up people. And last but not least, I'd like to know more about this new working habit that facinates me: yes, coworking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Claire with her english breakfast" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/claire-english-breakfast-74d3282c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-plan-amsterdam"&gt;The plan: Amsterdam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem! This summer, I'm editing a short-documentary. I'll work on it but… abroad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"So. Where do you want to go?"
— asking Cecile &lt;br /&gt;
"Amsterdam!"
— was my answer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely! It's a pretty city, close to Lille and not that expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one week before our departure, we booked an Airbnb room, looked for a place to park our car and sent emails to 2-3 coworking spaces.
On the next monday, we were on the road to Amsterdam!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cheese store" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/amsterdam-gouda-6254881a.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="coworking-spaces"&gt;Coworking spaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="coworking-visa"&gt;Coworking Visa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found the first coworking space via the &lt;a href="http://www.coworkingvisamap.com/"&gt;Coworking Visa&lt;/a&gt; initiative. As an active member of a coworking space that participates in Coworking Visa, you can use any other participating space. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schoutsen"&gt;Marieke&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Boven de Balie and &lt;a href="http://www.launchdesk.nl/en/"&gt;Launchdesk&lt;/a&gt; we were able to crash at her coworking space for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Boven de Balie coworking space" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/boven-de-balie-b6d74b2c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="boven-de-balie"&gt;Boven de Balie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we discovered &lt;a href="http://www.bovendebalie.nl/"&gt;Boven de Balie&lt;/a&gt;, a classy and quiet coworking space.
Based in Leidseplein, this space is exremely well situated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tea is really good, plants and geek jokes are decorating walls.
Oh and every day at lunch break, they all share the typical Dutch lunch: cold sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked there 2 days and 2 mornings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dutch lunch at Boven de Balie" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/dutch-lunch-a7945898.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hackers--founders-building"&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Founders Building&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cecile, the geek girl of this trip, is using a service called &lt;a href="http://appsignal.com/"&gt;AppSignal&lt;/a&gt;. She was in contact with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thijsc"&gt;Thijs&lt;/a&gt;, one of the co-founders, that introduced us to &lt;a href="http://hackersandfounders.nl/"&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Founders&lt;/a&gt; Building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're located in a fabulous, old and so typical building from Amsterdam: narrow, tall and sometimes leaning over like all these buildings at the edge of canals. Bonus point for their nice garden!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hackers &amp;amp; Founders Building" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/hackers-and-founders-5f03deb1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we talk about IT. Events are often organized around technical stuff where people share best practices, knowledge, … but not only! In fact we've attended a Yoga course with an Irish teacher. True story guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People (mostly men) are really kind. They offered us tea, beer and took time to answer to our questions. Even better, they recommended us the best bars and restaurants we can find in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Best floor of Hackers &amp;amp; Founders Building" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/hackers-and-founders-open-space-e32b276c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visiting"&gt;Visiting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't split our trip by work / visit days. Instead, we've planned to work every day but worry not, we had time to visit the city. In fact, dutch people stop to work between 5 and 6 pm. So we followed their habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed restaurants and parcs, a lot of parcs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cecile in Amsterdam" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/cecile-i-amsterdam-c692e5e1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="to-sum-up"&gt;To sum up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a blazing sun and a welcoming atmosphere, we spent 4 days working, wandering, loosing ourselves in streets, parcs and restaurants of this wonderful city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote working is such a great concept! I think it's just the beginning of my journey in the joyful world of coworking abroad.
It's really interesting to see how other freelancers actually work and how other spaces are managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a ton of new ideas and can't wait to go on a new remote working trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fun-facts--hints"&gt;Fun facts &amp;amp; Hints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't try to be a hero and walk accross the city by foot. Just rent a bike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Dutch people love Satay sauce. You can find it in restaurants, snackbars and even supermarkets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was editing a &lt;a href="http://www.lesfilmsdesdeuxmains.com/2015/06/02/travailler-en-micro-osmose-le-financement-participatif/"&gt;documentary on our coworking space (FR only)&lt;/a&gt; from Lille. That was funny to see our usual coworkers on my laptop. It's like a part of &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/61299367@N05/"&gt;La Coroutine&lt;/a&gt; was there with us in Amsterdam. So we brought back a gift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plant in La Coroutine" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-08-10-amsterdam/la-coroutine-plant-9c3e9e37.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was so close from my place that it only took me 30 min train to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, Brussels, Belgium!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was so close from my place that it only took me 30 min train to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, Brussels, Belgium!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="brussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently one of the teachers at &lt;a href="http://lewagon.org/"&gt;Le Wagon Paris&lt;/a&gt; - a 9 weeks boot camp teaching Ruby and Ruby on Rails to entrepreneurs. Last February, they launched &lt;a href="http://lewagon.org/brussels"&gt;Le Wagon Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. In May they started the second batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I taught, why not visiting them and do some tourism in Brussels? Such a nice plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Music Instruments Museum, Brussels" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-05-13-brussels/brussels-music-instruments-museum-b6f14ee8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="another-4-days-abroad"&gt;Another 4 days abroad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-1-2---le-wagon--co-station"&gt;Day 1-2 - Le Wagon / Co-Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed in &lt;a href="http://www.co-station.com/"&gt;Co-Station&lt;/a&gt;, a massive 3000 m2 coworking space near by the central railway station, in the heart of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived just on time for the classmates picture. Also got lucky, it was the first day for Lien as teacher. There's not that much girls in IT so it's quite a thing to have a woman as teacher in Paris and in Brussels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff and students are really nice. It was pleasant to meet them and work from their space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Le Wagon Brussels at Co-Station" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-05-13-brussels/lewagon-brussels-c16034c7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Le Wagon Brussels at Co-Station" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-05-13-brussels/lewagon-brussels-co-station-5b0cfb89.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-3-4---visiting"&gt;Day 3-4 - Visiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to visit the city by walking across neighborhoods from the city center to Etterbeek, passing by Ixelles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also visited two small museums. First one was the &lt;a href="http://www.hortamuseum.be/"&gt;Horta house&lt;/a&gt; and the second one was the &lt;a href="http://choco-story-brussels.be/"&gt;Chocolate museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity of being in Brussels to join the &lt;a href="http://brug.be/"&gt;Belgian Ruby community&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="http://rubyburgers.co/"&gt;Ruby Burgers&lt;/a&gt; party. That was a nice meet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Horta House" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-05-13-brussels/brussels-horta-house-91f47ddb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-ive-learned"&gt;What I've learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say that Brussels is an international city. There're so much nationalities, it's amazing. You can either take subways/trams or just walk along the streets and see where you'll arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, people are easy going and for sure the beer is good. There're good bars where to crash near Flagey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="by-the-way-did-you-know"&gt;By the way, did you know…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…that Flagey is in fact a place? I used to listen to Musiq3 for years. This is a radio from Brussels that broadcasts classic music. Every year they organize the Flagey Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always taught it was a festival taking place in a charming small village called Flagey. It was quite a shock when I discovered that Flagey is a famous place in Ixelles where people like to go for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flagey place, Brussels" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-05-13-brussels/brussels-flagey-place-d06f064a.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next batch, I'll try a one week trip to Holland with a coworker from Lille, France.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second journey and a brand new adventure. This time, a friend joined me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's meet Thomas!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second journey and a brand new adventure. This time, a friend joined me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's meet Thomas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thomas"&gt;Thomas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Paris in 1984, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aryko"&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is now a full packed Chti living in Lille, France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-poland"&gt;Why Poland?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to Poland for a special occasion. We attended a Ruby conference. In fact one of the best Ruby conference in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as we're really lucky. It turns out that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mkonikowski"&gt;Mateusz&lt;/a&gt;, one of our ex-coworker, is living in Warsaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mateusz &amp;amp; Thomas" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-03-11-poland/mateusz-and-thomas-a36e60aa.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="days-in-warsaw--wroclaw"&gt;5 days in Warsaw / Wroclaw&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's go! We'd visited him in Warsaw and then went to Wroclaw for the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-1-visiting-warsaw"&gt;Day 1: Visiting Warsaw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent our first day in Poland visiting the city. Fortunately, that was a sunny day. We visited the old town and went back by foot to the city center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon, we visited the insurrection museum and spent the evening with our friend.
What a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Visiting Warsaw" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-03-11-poland/warsaw-old-center-efd3e440.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-2-4-conference-in-wroclaw"&gt;Day 2-4: Conference in Wroclaw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't have much time to visit Wroclaw. I already visited the city so it didn't bothered me. Anyway, the &lt;a href="http://wrocloverb.com/"&gt;wroc_love.rb conference&lt;/a&gt; was really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Attending Wroclove.rb" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-03-11-poland/wrocloverb-conference-c057c2d7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-5-working-from-foap-in-warsaw"&gt;Day 5: Working from Foap in Warsaw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Warsaw for our last day, we decided to work from there. We didn't have the opportunity to look for a coworking space. &lt;a href="https://foap.com/"&gt;Foap&lt;/a&gt;, the company where our friend was working simply proposed us to work from their office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They lend us their meeting room. What can we say about their office? Just amazing. Big open space not crowded at all. Plus a kitchen, meeting rooms, ping pong table room and a huge room dedicated to thawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it's already time to say goodbye. For sure we'll come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Working from Foap office" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-03-11-poland/foap-office-996a1d2d.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-ive-learned"&gt;What I've learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food. The food is so cheap and you have so much quantity in your plate. That's incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most important, I've learned that train is really slow in this country. So slow that in general it's indicated to prefer bus over trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to take express trains. These are not high speed train. They just stop to 5-8 stations instead of 20+. You're now warned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="l-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old man killing time in so slow Polish train" src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2015-03-11-poland/polish-train-1cdc2983.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a different journey from the first one. I liked to travel with a friend and visit another one on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next trip may be closer. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
