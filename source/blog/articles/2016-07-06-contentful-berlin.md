Guten Tag! it’s David!<br>
I currently work as a [Front-end engineer consultant](http://www.davidl.fr/) in Lille, France. I had the chance to visit the [contentful HQ](https://www.contentful.com/about-us/) in Berlin.
4 Days to explore this city, meet the team, plus an amazing mission: watch the match France vs Germany in incognito mode.

## Berlin — Capital of Germany

During my trip, I visited a lot of places just by walking. It would have been a shame to not enjoy the sun and it’s easier to practice my favorite activity: __getting lost & dicovering new places__.

- Alexander Platz
- Berliner Dom
- The Chaos Computer Club
- Checkpoint Charlie
- Plenty of “straße”
- & Ampelmann Shop (Yes, in Berlin there are custom traffic light men)

## Meeting people: Agile Board Hacks at ThoughtWorks

This was my first time in Berlin. So what is the best way to meet some people? … I am a community leader of some meetups in Lille. Maybe I can find a great one in Berlin!

Few hours after landing, I am at ThoughtWorks Werkstatt for an event called [Agile Board Hacks](http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/ThoughtWorks-Berlin/events/232224931/).

Nick Thorpe uses examples of agile walls from his blog — [https://agileboardhacks.com](https://agileboardhacks.com) — where teams try to ship features faster or try to solve problems.

## 2 days at Contentful HQ

### about:contentful

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) has a mission: __avoid the web-focused CMSs__ — aka See As Mess systems. Those didn’t fit for the web in XXI century — the web of mobile, interactive & multichannel content.

Actually contentful is a tool for developers: it's an API with a focus on content.

- Developers are happy because it’s not a [bloated backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat)
- CMS addicts are happy because they can edit content on a web platform
- Businesses are happy because they have a [clear pricing page](https://www.contentful.com/pricing/)

_This is where magic happens_

### Meeting the team

I talked with la lot of smart people who are involved in the product.

As a Chief Marketing Officer, Chris wants multiple experiences for Contentful. What if customer were allowed to have built-in solution? You push the famous big red button and — Bam! Your new website is online with an astonishing theme… Maybe they are working on it? #revelation #stayTunned

Artas is Product Marketing Manager and one of his issues is about __automation__. It’s funny because it reminds me one of my favorite quotes.

> Whatever you do, make sure you are __automating__, because if you aren’t, all you are doing is making it harder for yourself when you revisit the __problem__, and making it even harder for the next __person__ who will inevitably have to __reproduce__ your __solution__.
> <cite> Githuber at Puppet conf</cite>

I also met Eugene — Copywriter & he shared with me an amazing website about Typography [typesetinthefuture.com](https://typesetinthefuture.com/).

But wait it's lunch time!

After the lunch, I met Marko, Claus & Jan (Designer & developer).

We talked about how I code / organise atomic design systems like [patternlab](http://patternlab.io/). We are all obsessed with performance so we shared with each other our best tools about image optimsation :

- [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo): A nodejs-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files.

- [ImageOptim-CLI](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI): Automate the optimisations of images.

### Time to chill a bit

At the end of the day, I had a great time with the Kr3w: playing table tennis in the chilling zone.

- A color book
- A Rubik's Cube
- A bunch of stickers
- A Tshirt
