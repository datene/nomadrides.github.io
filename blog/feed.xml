&lt;p&gt;So yeah, Brussels, Belgium!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was so close from my place that it only took me 30 min train to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, Brussels, Belgium!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="brussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently one of the teachers at Le Wagon Paris - a 9 weeks boot camp teaching Ruby and Ruby on Rails to entrepreneurs. Last February, they launched Le Wagon Brussels. In May they started the second batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I taught, why not visiting them and do some tourism in Brussels? Such a nice plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="another-4-days-abroad"&gt;Another 4 days abroad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-1-2---le-wagon--co-station"&gt;Day 1-2 - Le Wagon / Co-Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed in Co-Station, a massive 3000 m2 coworking space near by the central railway station, in the heart of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived just on time for the classmates picture. Also got lucky, it was the first day for Lien as teacher. There's not that much girls in IT so it's quite a thing to have a woman as teacher in Paris and in Brussels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff and students are really nice. It was pleasant to meet them and work from their space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-3-4---visiting"&gt;Day 3-4 - Visiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to visit the city by walking across neighborhoods from the city center to Etterbeek, passing by Ixelles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also visited two small museums. First one was the Horta house and the second one was the Chocolate museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity of being in Brussels to join the Belgian Ruby community for a Ruby Burgers party. That was a nice meet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-ive-learned"&gt;What I've learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say that Brussels is an international city. There're so much nationalities, it's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either take subways/trams or just walk along the streets and see where you'll arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, people are easy going and for sure the beer is good. There're good bars where to crash near Flagey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="by-the-way-did-you-know"&gt;By the way, did you know…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…that Flagey is in fact a place? I used to listen to Musiq3 for years. This is a radio from Brussels that broadcasts classic music. Every year they organize the Flagey Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always taught it was a festival taking place in a charming small village called Flagey. It was quite a shock when I discovered that Flagey is a famous place in Ixelles where people like to go for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next batch, I'll try a one week trip to Holland with a coworker from Lille, France.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poland (11 Mar - 16 Mar)</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second journey and a brand new adventure. This time, a friend joined me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's meet Thomas!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second journey and a brand new adventure. This time, a friend joined me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's meet Thomas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thomas"&gt;Thomas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Paris in 1984, Thomas is now a full packed Chti living in Lille, France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-poland"&gt;Why Poland?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to Poland for a special occasion. We attended a Ruby conference. In fact one of the best Ruby conference in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as we're really lucky. It turns out that one of our ex-coworker is leaving in Warsaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="days-in-warsaw--wroclaw"&gt;5 days in Warsaw / Wroclaw&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's go! We'd visited him in Warsaw and then went to Wroclaw for our conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-1-visiting-warsaw"&gt;Day 1: Visiting Warsaw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent our first day in Poland visiting the city. Fortunately, that was a sunny day. We visited the old town and went back by foot to the city center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon, we visited the insurrection museum and spent the evening with our friend.
What a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-2-4-conference-in-wroclaw"&gt;Day 2-4: Conference in Wroclaw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't have much time to visit Wroclaw. I already visited the city so it didn't bothered me. Anyway, the conference was really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-5-working-from-foap-in-warsaw"&gt;Day 5: Working from Foap in Warsaw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Warsaw for our last day, we decided to work from there. We didn't have the opportunity to look for a coworking space. The company where our friend was working simply proposed us to work from their office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They lend us their meeting room. What can we say about their office? Just amazing. Big open space not crowded at all. Plus a kitchen, meeting rooms, ping pong table room and a huge room dedicated to thawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it's already time to say goodbye. For sure we'll come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-ive-learned"&gt;What I've learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food. The food is so cheap and you have so much quantity in your plate. That's incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most important, I've learned that train is really slow in this country. So slow that in general it's indicated to prefer bus over trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to take express trains. These are not high speed train. They just stop to 5-8 stations instead of 20+. You're now warned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a different journey from the first one. I liked to travel with a friend and visit another one on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next trip may be closer. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First journey: London (26 Feb - 1 mar)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nomadrides.com/blog/2015-02-26-london.html"/>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So here I am. My journey begins with London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So here I am. My journey begins with London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-london"&gt;Why London?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="friends"&gt;Friends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good friend and ex-coworker moved there last September. He has invited me several times to come see him. So I taught it was logic to begin my journey by actually visiting him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="distance--transport"&gt;Distance / Transport&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is close to Lille so I may have short commute time (in theory). The good news is that there are direct trains and buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hosting"&gt;Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally my friend and his wife invited me to share their home so I hadn't to look for a place to stay. Otherwise, I should have took time to look for a Couchsurfing host, Airbnb room or hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="days-in-london"&gt;4 days in London&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to equally split my time : 2 days of work and 2 days of visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-1-working-from-tymberyard"&gt;Day 1: Working from Tymberyard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Tymberyard cafe, had a nice quiche for lunch and worked there all the afternoon. Of course, I did respect the tea time habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my first cafe-working experience. It's pleasant to work among fifteen other cafe-workers and in a lovely place with a good playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cafe is well situated, near Barbican station. No need to mention that it looks like the spirit of Shoreditch arrived in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-2-working-from-work-hubs"&gt;Day 2: Working from @Work Hubs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a heavy user of a coworking space in Lille, I wanted to try one in London. Philip Dodson welcomed me in his space @Work Hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a starter pass, chose a desk, had some ginger-lemon tea and started to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space is situated near Euston Square station. There are long desks, armchairs, free tea and biscuits and a small library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I also found there the first book from Hugh Laurie and bought it in favor of a non-profit organization. Had so much fun reading the adventures of Mr. Lang (The Gun Seller).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-3-4-visiting"&gt;Day 3-4: Visiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to visit! Hung out with my friends, had a walk in parks and the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-ive-learned"&gt;What I've learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="high-prices"&gt;High prices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No big news here. London is an expensive city. If you go to London, you should make sure you have budget for oyster card credits, coworking space pass and food in cafés.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned my travel 2 weeks ago. So the train rates weren't affordable anymore. Unsurprisingly, I took a bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long 6 hours ride including 30 minutes in a huge stainless can, on a train, in the depths of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it's not that terrible. We drove all the night so I just slept. OK, I had to take a nap before starting my first day work but that's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="london-coworking-spaces"&gt;London coworking spaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaces referenced on coworking visa website don't exist anymore or don't propose hotdesking anymore. On top of that, hotdesking spaces are hard to find for a newcomer. It also seems that there is no non-profit coworking spaces in the center of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this first working-trip. I liked to live as a Londoner on weekdays and be a tourist on weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, I'll continue my journey in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I'm a web developer, as a freelancer, I can work from any place that have a network connection.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I'm a web developer, as a freelancer, I can work from any place that have a network connection.
Fine! This year I'll travel across Europe!
My goal is pretty simple: discover new places while working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules are simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to a new place for 4 to 15 days (maximum)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Book few days for work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the rest, just enjoy your journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-just-2-weeks"&gt;Why just 2 weeks?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to spend all my time traveling. I also like to be at home and enjoy my beautiful city (Lille, France). BUT, for now, I do want to visit a lot of cities.
So here is the deal: &lt;strong&gt;traveling on short period, traveling often&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
